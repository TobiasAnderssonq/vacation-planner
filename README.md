# Vacation Planner!

## Improvements

- Due to the time restrait no testing was taken into consideration
- If I would take this project further I would put more effort into deciding which styling and theme to follow.
  Now I just went with default tailwind to get things running.
- Put more effort into better looking error states
- I only added a prettier config for code formatting, to make it scalable I would also include linting rules.
- Depending on what context the app would be used, consider more about WCAG principles and responsiveness.
- Add deployments together with CI/CD pipelines
- In a proper setting I would also have divided the work into separate commits rather than pushing it all as an "initial commit".

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
